## Introduction

### Problem to Be Solved

The goal of this program is to accurately classify natural images using a multi-layered model trained on a specific dataset, CIFAR-10. 

### Relevance of Problem

Being able to classify natural images could lead to benefits in the real world. For example, sightings of endagered or near-extinct animals could be detected through the classifier when processing large amounts of images online, leading to possible better protection of animals.

### Plan to Solve Problem

To solve the problem, a pipeline will be developed that is capable of preprocessing, augmentation, training, prediction, and validation, and uses a CNN-based DNN for classification. This pipeline will be a deep learning solution to classifying natural images and will be able to uniquely classify into 10 classes.

### Justification for a DL Solution

A random forest classifier was tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the accuracy scores for validation and testing were 0.4 ??? and 0.4 ??? respectively. These scores were very poor in classifying the images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, no matter which hyperparameters were changed. This lead to the conclusion that the random forest classifier was not well-versed enough to solve this problem, and that a deep learning solution was required.
